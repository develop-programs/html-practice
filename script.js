// Import and Export in JS
// Monolithic and Modular approach
// Monolithic = Everything in one file
// Modular = Splitting code into multiple files

// Import = To use code from another file
// We are importing the code from the file 'Date.js'

// Import is included in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
const {date} = require('./Date.js');
console.log(date());
